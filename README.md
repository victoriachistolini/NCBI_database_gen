# About The Automatic Dataset Generation App

The Automatic Dataset Generation App is currently my main focus project and is under development. The application is written in Java/ JavaFX and is designed to streamline the process of curating sequence datasets of noncoding regions upstream, downstream and intronic to a target gene for the desired input species.

The software design features the MVC  pattern and uses automatic web queries to the NCBI API to request the necessary data.

The user interface is an important part of the application and currently features a simple background image and menu which hosts all of the supported actions. In the future the background screen will be used to display project settings information, and document to the progression and progress of the curation, which may take a while. Future work may also consist in using the background display to support visualizations of sequence on the UCSC genome browser.
